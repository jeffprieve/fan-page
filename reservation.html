            <h2>Reservation Information - Some General Tips</h2>
            <p>The BWCA attracts approximately a quarter of a million visitors a year. Getting a reservation is not as easy now as it was 30 or 40 years ago. Also, depending on your tolerance for weather and insects, there’s a couple of things to consider when planning your trip.<br><br> Before you can get a reservation, you have to pick an entry point. You don’t have to specify what lake you’re going to, just where you’re going in, and approximately when you’re coming out. You’ll also need to know where you’re going to pick your permit up (which ranger station or co-op). maps of available stations and co-ops are available at the website listed below. But first let’s talk about consideration’s to make before picking your entry point.  </p>
                <h4>Weather Tolerance</h4>
                <p>Weather in a nutshell: Early May can still have Ice and swimming is out. June is Beautiful. July is hot. Early August is hot, but later August can be nice. Early September is also very pleasant. Later September can start to get a little colder, but still nice. October can be cold. And for winter campers, you on your own. I’ve never been there in the frosty months! My ideal time is late May, late August, or anytime in September.</p>
                <h4>Bugs</h4>
                <p>Bugs will vary by Month also. Keep in mind they do NOT spray up there, and there’s a LOT of water, so when I say bugs, it’s not like in the cities. May is generally bug free. June is awful. Although it’s nice temperatures, if you don’t like bugs, don’t go in June. July is a little better, but don’t forget DEET! Early August is better yet, and by later August they’ve settled down. Early September is they’ve started to disappear, and by late September they’re gone.</p>
                <h4>East vs. West</h4>
                <p>When picking an entry point, you might consider topography. Generally speaking, If you go in on the Grand Marais side (the East side) you’ll have more cliffs and structure. If you go in on the West side (Ely) you have more marshes, but also a better chance of seeing a Moose.</p>
                <h4>Portage Length, and traveler types</h4>
                <p>To get to these lakes, you have to carry everything. So one consideration is, how far do you want to portage, or walk, and how many portages do you want to do. Look at the lake maps ahead of time. These can be seen online, or bought from stores like REI, Gander mountain, or Cabela’s. Another thing to discuss before you plan, is what kind of ‘trip’ this is going to be. Generally BWCA ‘trippers’ fall into 3 categories:<br><br>
Base Campers - Go in and find a camp site. Stay there the entire time, and  maybe take some day trips<br><br>
Trippers – Pack up and move every day to a new camp. A lot more work, and if you a base campers, and you end up with a group of trippers, there’s going to be some unhappy campers. <br><br>
            Combination – some people will set up camp for a day or two, then move.<br><br> 
	As you can guess, there is no ‘right’ approach, but for all to be happy, it is important that all agree on what type of trip this is going to be before you hit the water. This may also affect the entry point you choose.
